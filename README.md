# Pauper Scholar â€” Get it in [Chrome Web Store]

Pauper Scholar is a Chrome extension for the Google Scholar website which adds an ability to differentiate between free-access and paid-access articles, in particular, it can hide all paid-access articles in search results.

Please note that the extension detects the type of an article based on whether there's a url to an article text or to a library specified in your settings next to its search result. If there's no such a url, the extension claims it's a paid-access one. However, it could still be a free-access one which was indexed wrong (see [Inclusion#Indexing]) and thus lacks a direct url to its text on the search result page.

If you have a relatively small total number of search results, Pauper Scholar recommends that you first look through all free-access results, and then try high-probability paid-access results some of which may turn out to be free-access ones.
