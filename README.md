# Pauper Scholar â€” Get it in [Chrome Web Store]

Pauper Scholar is a Chrome extension for the Google Scholar website which adds an ability to differentiate between free-access and paid-access articles, in particular, it can hide all paid-access articles in search results.

An article is considered to be a free-access one if there's a link to a paper next to it.
